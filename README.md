# To-do List App
 To-do list website built with Flask, Bootstrap, and SQL 

# Functionality 
Authentication, Data Storage with PostgreSQL, Form submissions 

# Look and Feel 
Used Bootstrap examples and online templates to get a very basic and barebones look and feel. Focused primarily on the functionality. May change the look in the future when I learn more front end design. 

# Learnings
Learned how to with SQL databases (store, retrieve, edit, delete), authenticate users with flask_login, and handle POST and GET requests to update information.
